- Location: BLOC 521
<!-- - [Recording]() -->


### Description
Join us for a hands-on workshop on deep Q-Learning, a method that enables machines to learn from their environment, make decisions, and ultimately optimize their actions to achieve desired outcomes. From gaming strategies to robotics and finance, deep Q-learning has demonstrated its prowess across a plethora of applications. In this workshop, through a combination of lectures, interactive discussions, and hands-on coding exercises, attendees will:

1. Understand the fundamentals: Grasp the foundational concepts of reinforcement learning, including Markov decision processes, reward functions, and the deep Q-Learning algorithm itself.
2. Explore real-world applications: Gain insights into how deep Q-Learning is revolutionizing industries such as gaming, robotics, finance, and more through real-world case studies and examples.
3. Implement deep Q-Learning: Roll up your sleeves and dive into a practical coding session where you'll learn to implement deep Q-Learning from scratch using Python and PyTorch.

Attendees are encouraged to bring their laptops to follow along with the coding tutorial. Familiarity with the basics of Python and PyTorch is expected.
