### Topic

My experience pursuing a career in industry

### Abstract

Most Ph.D. programs focus on preparing their students for a career in academia and offer very little guidance about how to make the transition into industry. For this talk, I will describe my experience with applying and interviewing for industry positions, and will share some of my insights about this process. I will describe the two industry positions I have held since completing my Ph.D. in Quantitative Psychology: a data scientist at an assessment company and a statistician at a software company, Stata. I will explain the general setup of both companies, the different roles of employees with higher education degrees, and my particular role in each company. Finally, I will offer some advice on how graduate students can decide whether a career in industry is right for them and how they can gain the skills necessary to become a competitive candidate in the industry job market.
