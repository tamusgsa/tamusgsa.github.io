### Description
 Causal inference is a fundamental
and one of the mostactive areas of research,
with a vast literature spanning across
decades in both statistics and machine
learning, and with wide applications across
disciplines, including biology, computer
science, econometrics etc. The causality
literature is fairly diverse as well, with varied
goals and associated methods.In this lecture,
I will focus on the causal inference literature
for treatment effect estimation, specifically
the average treatment effect (ATE), from
observational data - which are increasingly
popular in the modern “big data” era due to
their rich and large-scale nature.I will first
introduce the basic principles and philosophy
guiding such causal problems, including
counterfactual reasoning and the “potential
outcome” framework.I will then discuss the
key challenges with observational data (as
opposed to randomized trials which are the
gold standard) dueto issues of confounding
and selection bias, and the key causal
assumptions one needs to make for valid
inference. Thereafter, I will discuss specific
strategies for identification and estimation
of ATE from such data. In particular, I will
discuss three popular methods: inverse
probability weighting (IPW), regression
adjustment, and augmented IPW (so-called
doubly robust or double machine learning)
estimators. Their advantages/disadvantages
will be discussed in detail and someoftheir
theoretical and empirical properties will be
discussed briefly as well.
