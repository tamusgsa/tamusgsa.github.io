### Description

First, I will briefly discuss a few projects I am currently involved in. Then, I will delve into the project on understanding circadian rhythms. Circadian clocks are the body's internal clocks that regulate physiological activities, including metabolism, detoxification, and digestion, to name a few. Scientists are interested in unraveling the role of the master regulator (related to the mTOR protein), food, and drugs on the circadian rhythm. Towards this broader goal, Menet's lab has collected transcriptomic data under different experimental conditions. However, there are no comprehensive statistical tools to analyze such data. I will show you how we have approached the problem, accompanied by some exciting numerical results.   



### Our Speaker

Dr. Samiran Sinha, a Professor of Statistics, works primarily in statistical methodology for epidemiology and public health. Many of his works are related to measurement error (mismeasurement in key variables) and missing or partially missing data. He employs a range of modeling strategiesâ€”parametric, semiparametric, nonparametric, often combined with newer computational tools. His current work involves efficient computation, feature selection, high-dimensional data with application to genomics. Dr. Sinha is also involved in graduate and undergraduate teaching, mentoring students, and collaborating on interdisciplinary projects in public health and statistics.
