### Topic

Non-Gaussian Factor Model for Interpretable Ordinal Time Series Analysis


### Abstract

In this talk, Dr. Ni and Dr. Bruce will first provide a general overview of their research interests and ongoing projects in biomedical time series analysis, causal learning, and interpretable statistical methods. The remainder of the talk will introduce a collaborative research effort to develop an interpretable factor model for learning causal structures in ordinal time series data.
