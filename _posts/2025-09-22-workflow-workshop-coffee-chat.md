We're excited to kick off a new session series with a casual opportunity to meet the professors in our department. For this first session, we'll be joined by three professors who have recently joined our department: Dr. Jade Wang, Dr. Debangan Dey, and Dr. Austin Brown. 

During the session, you'll have the opportunity to: 
Meet and interact with our new professors
Hear about their career journeys and early experiences as faculty 
Ask questions about navigating the academic job market, the application process, and interviews
Gain practical advice and tips for building a successful career in academia
The session will be an informal conversation over some coffee and refreshments. Please come with questions!
