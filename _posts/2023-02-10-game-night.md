Hi Everyone,

From the survey responses it seems that Friday, Feb 10 would be our best option this month. We'll have the game night at Fisherbowl, 5-7pm. We'll have plenty of board games and food, and it'll be a great opportunity to connect with other students and just have fun. Please fill out this (short) [form](https://forms.gle/ApVkowKCqCBKNyYU7) by no later than Thursday, 5pm-this gives us a headcount.

Hoping to see everyone there!
