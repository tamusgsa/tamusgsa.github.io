### Description
 In this talk, I'll explore the close relationship between statistics and optimization,
illustrating how each field enhances the other in tackling complex data problems. The
presentation will be divided into two parts. In the first part, | will talk about algorithms for
Instrumental Variable Regression (IVaR) by viewing the problem as a Conditional
Stochastic Optimization (CSO) problem. In the context of least-squares IVaR, our
algorithms neither require matrix inversions nor mini-batches and provides a fully online
approach for performing instrumental variable regression with streaming data. When the
true model is linear, we derive rates of convergence in expectation, that are of order
O(log T/T) and O(1/Tâ„¢1-1) for any L > O, respectively under the availability of two-sample
and one-sample oracles, where T is the number of iterations. Importantly, under the
availability of the two-sample oracle, our procedure avoids explicitly modeling and
estimating the relationship between the independent and the instrumental variables,
demonstrating the benefit of the proposed approach over recent works based on
reformulating the problem as minimax optimization problems. Numerical experiments are
provided to corroborate the theoretical results. In the second part, | will talk about my
future research directions. | will specifically focus on learning with dueling feedback, how
does transformer learn and causal inference.
