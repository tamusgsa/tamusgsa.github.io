Hi everyone,

We were planning to organize a Game Night once a month (tentatively, depending on availability) in Fisher Bowl. Please fill out the following survey about your day/week/time preferences for February. I will send out a similar survey at the beginning of every month. 

[Google Form](https://forms.gle/MzPZkgTzDQ55pBNA8)

- Food/snacks will be provided.
- If you have any board games, you are more than welcome to bring them.
