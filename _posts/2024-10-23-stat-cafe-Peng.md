### Description
 
Recent progress in multiplexed tissue imaging is advancing the study of tumor
microenvironments to enhance our understanding of treatment response and disease
progression. Despite its popularity, there are significant challenges in data analysis,
including high computational demands that limit feasibility for large-scale applications
and the lack of a principled strategy for integrative analysis across images. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a spatial topic model designed to decode high-level
spatial architecture across multiplexed tissue images. Our method integrates both cell
type and spatial information within a topic modelling framework, originally developed for
natural language processing and adapted for computer vision. We benchmarked its
performance through various case studies using different single-cell spatial
transcriptomic and proteomic imaging platforms across different tissue types. We show
that our method runs significant faster on large-scale image datasets, along with high
precision and interpretability. We also demonstrate it consistently identifies biologically
and clinically significant spatial “topics”, such as tertiary lymphoid structures.
