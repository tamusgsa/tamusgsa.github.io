### Description

Revolutionary technologies and treatment protocols have generated a surge in spatially resolved and imaging datasets, such as spatial transcriptomics and brain imaging. This presentation shares two statistical methods tailored to these settings. One is ELLA, which detects subcellular mRNA localization in super-resolution spatial transcriptomics. The other is BI-GMRF, which conducts Bayesian mediation analysis with high-dimensional brain imaging mediators.


### Our Speaker

Dr. Jade (Xiaoqing) Wang is an Assistant Professor of Statistics who joined this fall. She is interested in developing novel statistical/computational methods and implementing cutting-edge AI tools to empower effective analysis of biomedical data, such as spatial transcriptomics and neuroimaging. She completed postdoctoral training in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan and at St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital, and she earned her PhD in Statistics from CUHK. She is thrilled to join the department and looks forward to interacting with everyone.
