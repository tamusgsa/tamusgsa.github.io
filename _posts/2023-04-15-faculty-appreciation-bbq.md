Thank you for your RSVP to the Faculty/Staff Appreciation BBQ. As a reminder, the BBQ is tomorrow, April 15th starting at 4:00pm in Pavillion A at Tiffany Park. If you still have not coordinated a ride and still need one, please let one of the SGSA officers know. If you are driving to Tiffany Park, please do NOT park in the church parking lot across the street. Parking is located at the park, on the street, and in the Bowen Elementary School parking lot.

Tiffany Park has soccer fields, basketball and volleyball courts, and is pet friendly. We will provide volleyballs/basketballs/soccer balls but you can bring your own too if you want. There's a kids' play area nearby as well.

We look forward to seeing you there!
