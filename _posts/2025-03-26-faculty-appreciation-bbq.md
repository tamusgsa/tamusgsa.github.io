Itâ€™s that time of the year again to express our gratitude for the dedication and hard work of our faculty and staff! On behalf of SGSA, I am thrilled to extend a warm invitation to you all for our annual Faculty and Staff Appreciation BBQ at the pavilion at John Crompton Park on Sunday, April 6 from 1:00 to 4:00 PM.

John Crompton Park features a range of amenities including a basketball court, a scenic pond, jogging and walking trails, and playgrounds for children. We hope all of you will join us for an enjoyable afternoon of BBQ and outdoor games.
