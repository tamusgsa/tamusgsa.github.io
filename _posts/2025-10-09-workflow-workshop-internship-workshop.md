Curious what it's really like to intern at places like Google, J.P. Morgan, National Lab, or a pro sports team? Join us to hear firsthand from fellow Aggies who landed competitive internships and pick up some practical advice on how to land your internship this coming summer. 

Our panelists will share what the application process was like, what kind of projects they worked on, and what they wish they had known before starting. You'll also have a chance to ask questions, get resume feedback, and connect with them afterwards. 

### Our panelists:
- Valeriya (Google)
- Carrie (Lawrence Livermore National Lab)
- Leo (Oklahoma City Thunder)
- Joyce (J.P. Morgan)

### Agenda: 
- 4:00-4:20 Introductions
- 4:20-4:40 General Q&A 
- 4:40-5:00 Individual breakout with panelists 

The first half will cover their internship experiences and key lessons to success. In the second half, you'll get the chance to speak with each panelist one-on-one. Bring your resume or questions for personalized feedback!
