We will have the last Game Night of the semester on Friday, April 21st, 5-7pm. Thanks to the efforts of Gozde Sert and the generous help from Climate and Diversity Committee we now have the following games in addition to what we had last time:

- Ludo
- Jenga
- Yut
- Yacht
- Werewolf
- Uno
- Catan
- Carrom

Additionally, if you aren't familiar with some of the games, please don't worry, someone who knows will happily teach you the rules.

Please fill out the following one-question RSVP form by 4pm, Thursday, April 20th to indicate whether you are coming or not- this gives us a headcount for the food.
