### Topic
DNA Copy Number Profiling: from Bulk Tissue to Single Cells


### Abstract
Copy number variations (CNVs) are duplications and deletions, resulting in gains and losses of DNA segments. CNVs are an abundant source of variations and have been associated with diseases. High-throughput DNA sequencing enables detection of CNVs on the genome-wide scale but suffers from biases and artifacts that lead to false discoveries and low sensitivity. In this talk, I will discuss statistical methods that we have developed for profiling full-spectrum CNVs at high resolution, utilizing bulk-tissue and single-cell DNA sequencing data. If time permits, I will also give an overview of our past and ongoing efforts on interrogating gene regulatory network and detecting circadian rhythmicity by single-cell multiomic approaches.
