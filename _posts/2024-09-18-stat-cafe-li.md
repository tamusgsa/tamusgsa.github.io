### Description
Watermarking in LLM generated text is a technique that involves embedding (nearly)
unnoticeable statistical signals within generated content to help trace its source. We
focus on a scenario where an untrusted third-party user sends prompts to a trusted
language model (LLM) provider, who then generates a text from their LLM with a
watermark. This setup makes it possible for a detector to later identify the source of the
text if the user publishes it. The user can modify the generated text by substitutions,
insertions, or deletions. Our objective is to develop a statistical method to detect if a
published text is LLM-generated, mainly from the perspective of a detector. We further
propose a methodology to segment the published text into watermarked and nonwatermarked sub-strings. The proposed approach is built upon randomization tests and
change point detection techniques. We demonstrate that our method ensures Type I and
Type II error control and can accurately identify watermarked sub-strings by finding the
corresponding change point locations. To validate our technique, we apply it to texts
generated by several language models with prompts extracted from Google's C4 dataset
and obtain encouraging numerical results.
