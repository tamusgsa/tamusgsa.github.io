On behalf of SGSA I am pleased to announce that we'll be having our yearly Faculty and Staff appreciation BBQ at Tiffany Park on Apr 15th, 4-6pm. Please fill out the following RSVP form by April 3, Monday so we can have a headcount.

Tiffany Park has soccer fields, basketball and volleyball courts, and is pet friendly. We will provide volleyballs/basketballs/soccer balls but you can bring your own too if you want. There's a kids' play area nearby as well.

Lastly, this year, we are a bit short on funds so we're asking the students to either donate 10$ towards the food or bring a dish. I'll send a follow up email with details on how to pay. If you have any questions, please reach out to me or Will Boyles.
